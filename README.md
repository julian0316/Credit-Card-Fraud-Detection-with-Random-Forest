Predicting Credit Card Fraudulent Transactions 

# Problem:

1) Fraud detection is a truly important problem to any e-commerce store, and companies put a lot of money to prevention because a single fraud can cost them a lot of money as well.

2) One of the biggest issues with this problem is that the vast majority of users will not be fraudulent.It is estimated that only 0.1% of online transactions are fraudulent, but given the volume of transactions that occur every day, that means a lot of money.

This will make it harder for us to detect the underlying patterns with the information available. This will cause our dataset to be highly imbalanced, so we need to use different sample techniques and use different metrics.

Thus, we are going to see how we can help solve this problem using Deep Learning algorithms using tools such as Python, TensorFlow and Keras.

# Case Study

We use a publicly available data set for these real credit card transactions that have been anonymized. This data contains over 300000 rows of transactions, all with their corresponding labels.

We are going to use the transaction history of many rows of sales to build a fraud detection system.

We have only numbers in the columns, as it has been anonymized, that means we don’t know which of the transactions attributes, such as the user’s IP location, how long he’s been one of our users, etc. Instead, we have numerical values that represent the same information.

# OUR OBJECTIVE: 

To build a fraud detection classifier that, given a new transaction, can tell us if it is fraudulent or not with a correspondent confidence level. # Which are our classes? : 

“0” label = Classifier is NOT fraudulent
“1” label (classifier IS fraudulent)

We are going to build both a deep learning network to try to do so, and apply more traditional ML algorithms such as Random Forest as well. 

Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques complement each other; in our case, we will be doing A|B testing to see which mode performs best, so once we cover our deep neural network, we are going to start using machine learning using the Python sckit-learn library
